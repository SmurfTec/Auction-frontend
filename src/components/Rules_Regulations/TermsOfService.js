        <Typography variant='body1' className={classes.para}>
          This Provision provides that all disputes between You and Us shall be
          resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of These Terms
          constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigation claims and all
          opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer this because We
          believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear,
          there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
          arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow these Terms
          and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including
          attorney’s fees). You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which
          means You would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a
          court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be
          represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not
          limited to, class actions).

          If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided
          above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either You or We may initiate
          arbitration proceedings. The arbitration shall be commenced as an

          class arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or

          For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the

          Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the

          or condition precedent to suit.
